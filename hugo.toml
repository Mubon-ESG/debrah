Debrah is a space for honest thinking about ESG.<br>
This blog is not about writing better sustainability reports — it is about building <strong>real, measurable performance</strong> behind them.<br>
Here, I share insights from ESG, procurement, and healthcare supply chains — where sustainability must stand up to decisions, not just narratives.
