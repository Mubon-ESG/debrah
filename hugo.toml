**English** ｜ [中文](/Debrah/ch/)

Debrah is a space for honest thinking about ESG.  
This blog is not about writing better sustainability reports —  
it is about building **real, measurable performance** behind them.

Here, I share insights from ESG, procurement, and healthcare supply chains —  
where sustainability must stand up to decisions, not just narratives.
