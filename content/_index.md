## Where ESG Performance Becomes Visible  

Debrah is a space for honest thinking about ESG.  
This blog is not about writing better sustainability reports —  
it’s about building **real, measurable performance** behind them.

I share insights from ESG, procurement, and healthcare supply chains —  
where sustainability must stand up to decisions, not just narratives.
