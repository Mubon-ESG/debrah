**About Debrah Blog**

<!--more-->

Debrah is a space for honest thinking about ESG.

This blog focuses not on writing better sustainability reports,  
but on understanding what creates **real, measurable performance** behind them.

Here, I share insights from ESG, procurement, and healthcare supply chains—  
where sustainability must stand up to decisions, not just narratives.
