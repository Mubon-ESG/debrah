## Opening

Many companies believe their ESG ratings are stuck because their reports are not good enough.

The narrative sounds familiar:
*“We need clearer disclosures.”*  
*“We need better alignment with frameworks.”*  
*“We need a more compelling ESG story.”*

But after years of working inside ESG initiatives, I have learned something uncomfortable:

**Most organizations do not have an ESG reporting problem.  
They have a performance problem.**

---

## Why better reports don’t lead to better ESG ratings

ESG ratings are often misunderstood.

They are not designed to reward elegant narratives or well-written reports.
They are designed to evaluate **what can be verified**.

When organizations focus primarily on improving the report itself, they often miss a critical point:
reports do not create performance — they reflect it.

If there is no measurable improvement behind the disclosure,
no amount of storytelling can sustainably improve ESG scores.

This is why many companies experience the same frustration year after year:
more effort, more pages, more alignment —
but little movement in ratings.

> **Key insight:**  
> ESG ratings improve when performance becomes visible, not when reports become polished.

## What ESG ratings actually respond to

Across major ESG evaluation frameworks, one pattern is consistent:
**measurable outcomes matter more than intentions.**

Ratings respond to signals such as:
- Evidence of reduced operational risk  
- Data-backed improvements in supplier performance  
- Consistency between policies and execution  
- Decision-making processes that can be traced and explained  

When these signals are weak or fragmented,
ratings stagnate — regardless of how complete the report appears.

---

## Where the real gap begins

The gap usually forms long before the reporting phase.

It begins when ESG initiatives are treated as parallel projects,
separate from operational and procurement decisions.

In this setup:
- Sustainability goals exist, but lack owners  
- Data is collected, but not decision-grade  
- ESG teams report effort, not outcomes  

As a result, reports end up describing ambition rather than performance.

---

## Why procurement determines what shows up in ESG reports

Procurement is where ESG either becomes measurable — or remains theoretical.

It is the function that connects sustainability goals to:
- Supplier selection  
- Cost and risk trade-offs  
- Data availability  
- Operational accountability  

When ESG is not embedded into procurement processes,
organizations struggle to produce the kind of evidence ESG ratings rely on.

Not because they lack commitment —
but because performance is never structured to be captured.

---

## What I focus on today

My work is grounded in a simple belief:

> **If ESG performance cannot be demonstrated, it cannot be rewarded.**

I help organizations shift their focus from
*“How do we complete the ESG report?”*
to
*“What performance must exist for the report to be credible?”*

When ESG goals are translated into procurement performance,
reports stop being a challenge —
they become a consequence.

---

## Closing thought

ESG ratings rarely fail because companies do not care.

They fail because performance is not designed to be seen.

When organizations stop treating ESG reporting as the problem,
and start building systems that generate real, traceable outcomes,
ratings begin to move.

Not because the story improved —
but because the performance finally did.
